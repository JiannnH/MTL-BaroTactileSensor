# MTL-BaroTactileSensor

This repository contains the code and hardware design for the research project titled "Superresolution of a Barometric Tactile Sensor." The project is being conducted as part of an MSc Thesis at Imperial College London, which is continually updating.

# Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop an integrated tactile sensor solution based on traditional barometers to produce a more precise and sophisticated tactile output. The project encompasses the entire development cycle, including PCB design, hardware design, data collection, and deep learning model training.

The primary focus of the project is on enhancing the resolution of tactile sensors using machine learning techniques.
